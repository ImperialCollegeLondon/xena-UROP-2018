/- 4. Let S be a set, and say ∼ is a binary relation on S which is symmetric and transitive. 
For s ∈ S, choose t ∈ S such that s ∼ t and then note that by symmetry we have t ∼ s, 
and then by transitivity we have s ∼ t and t ∼ s so s ∼ s. 
Hence ∼ is reflexive, and thus symmetric and transitive imply reflexive. 
This contradicts part (iv) of the previous question! Where is the mistake?-/
