M1F 2017-18 Sheet 1 Question 1
Author : Kevin Buzzard

This file should work with any version of lean -- whether you installed it yourself
or are running the version on https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/

-- Ignore the next 4 lines -- they are just defining the power notation :-)
--@[reducible] definition pow : int -> nat -> int
--| _ 0 := (1:int)
--| x (nat.succ n) := x * (pow x n)
--notation x `^` n := pow x n
-- Power notation is in the maths library but then you have to figure out
-- how to import the maths library. Now we have this definition, this
-- file *just works*, with any recent version of lean.

-- The rest of this file is the six parts of M1F Sheet 1 Q1.

-- part (a): which one of these is provable? Prove one, delete
-- the other.
