-- 2. For each of the following functions, decide whether or not they are injective, surjective, bijective. Proofs required!

-- (i) f : R → R, f(x) = 1/x if x ̸= 0 and f(0) = 0.
--theorem 
-- (ii) f : Z → Z, f(n) = 2n + 1.

-- (iii) f : R → R, f(x) = x3. [you can assume that every positive real has a unique positive real cube root, even though you haven’t really seen a formal proof of this yet.]

-- (iv) f : R → R defined by f(x) = x3 if the Riemann hypothesis is true, and f(x) = −x if not. [NB the is a hard unsolved problem in mathematics; nobody currently knows if it is true or false.]

-- (v) (hard) f : Z → Z, f(n) = n3 − 2n2 + 2n − 1.
