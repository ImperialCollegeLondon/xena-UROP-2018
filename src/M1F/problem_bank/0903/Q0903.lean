/- 3. An equivalence relation is a binary relation that satisfies three axioms – the relation has to be reflexive, symmetric and transitive. So to check that a given binary relation is an equivalence relation we have to check that each of these three things are true.
It seems reasonable to wonder whether we really need to check all three of them though – for example, perhaps it is the case that any binary relation which is reflexive and transitive is maybe automatically symmetric? If this is true then we wouldn’t have to bother checking symmetry, we could just check the other two and we could deduce symmetry.
(i) In this question I will explain how to prove that this does not happen. But before I go on to do this, why not stop reading this question and spend some time thinking about how one could prove that it is not possible to show that if a binary relation is reflexive and transitive, then it is automatically symmetric.
(ii)Let S be the real numbers and define a binary relation on S by a∼b iff a≤b. Prove that ∼ is reflexive and transitive (assuming any standard facts about inequalities that you might need). Prove that ∼ is not symmetric. Deduce that the two axioms of being reflexive and transitive do not imply the axiom of being symmetric (this is the answer to part (i)).
This leads us to two more natural questions – does reflexive and symmetric imply transitive, and does symmetric and transitive imply reflexive?
(iii) Let S be the set of real numbers and define x ∼ y iff |y−x| ≤ 1. Prove that ∼ is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive.
(iv) Let S be the set of real numbers, and define x ∼ y by saying that x ∼ y is never true, whatever the values of x and y (so the corresponding subset of S is the empty set). Prove that ∼ is symmetric and transitive, but not reflexive.-/
