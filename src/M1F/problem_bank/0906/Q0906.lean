/- 6. Say S = Z≥0 × Z≥0.
(i) Define a binary relation on S by (a, b) ∼ (c, d) if and only if a + d = b + c. Prove that ∼ is
an equivalence relation.
(ii) Define a map from S to Z by f((a,b)) = a − b. Prove that f is surjective, and that
(a,b) ∼ (c,d) if and only if f((a,b)) = f((c,d)).
(iii) Deduce that the set of equivalence classes for ∼ naturally bijects with Z. The ancient
sages actually used this as a definition of Z!
(iv) Let S be Z × Z≥1 and define (a,b) ∼ (c,d) iff ad = bc. Do the analogous exercise to the
one above (f ((a, b)) = a/b) to figure out how the ancient sages defined Q.-/
