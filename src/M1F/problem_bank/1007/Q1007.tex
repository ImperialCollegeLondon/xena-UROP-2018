(i) Say f : X → Y is surjective. Prove that there exists a function g : Y → X such that f ◦ g
is the identity function. Bonus point: in general, is g “natural”?
(ii) Say f : X → Y is injective. Does there always exist a function g : Y → X such that g ◦ f
is the identity function?
(iii)Say f : X → Y is any function. Does there always exist an injection g' : X → Z and a surjection h : Z → Y such that f=h◦g?
