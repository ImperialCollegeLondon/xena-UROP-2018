/- 2∗ This important question makes sure that you have definitely got the hang of equivalence classes. Try and get through as much of it as you can. Most of it is only very mild extensions of stuff I proved in lectures, so go back to your notes if you’re not sure, and ask your tutor if you need help.
Let S be a set, and let ∼ be an equivalence relation on S. In lectures I talked about the equivalence class cl(s) of an element s ∈ S. If I just talk about an equivalence class, I mean a subset of S which is equal to cl(s) for some s ∈ S.
(i) Let S be the set of all integers, and define an equivalence relation ∼ on S by a ∼ b if and only if a ≡ b mod 2. Prove that there are two equivalence classes, namely the subset of all even integers, and the subset of all odd integers.
(ii) Staying with the example in (i), is it possible to have two distinct elements a, b ∈ S with a ̸= b but cl(a) = cl(b)?
(iii) Staying with the example in (i), is it possible to have two equivalence classes X and Y (subsetsofS)withX̸=Y butX∩Y ̸=∅?
(iv) Now let’s go to the general case. Let S be any set, and let ∼ be an equivalence relation on S. Prove that if a,b ∈ S then cl(a) = cl(b) if and only if a ∼ b.
(v) Now prove that if a, b ∈ S then the following are equivalent: (a) cl(a) ∩ cl(b) ̸= ∅;
(b) a ∼ b;
(c) cl(a) = cl(b).
Note that to prove that these statements are equivalent, it would be enough to show that (a) implies (b), that (b) implies (c) and that (c) implies (a).-/
